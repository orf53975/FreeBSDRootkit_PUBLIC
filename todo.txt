### how to view all syscalls
checksyscall uses kvm_list which takes a names and retriels system table
entrties
by looking at the code that it uses, we can use that and kldsym to find the
symbols associated with every syscall to find all syscalls, and subsequently
detect and hide.
hooking kldsym so you can't find it.
