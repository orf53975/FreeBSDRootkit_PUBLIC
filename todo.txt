## Todo
* kldload/kldunload -- DONE: @B3nny
* getdirentries from ls, etc. -- DONE: @Hooplaa
* open/read for /proc
* DKOM: remove us from module linked list
* chdir - If we need a directory

### how to view all syscalls
checksyscall uses kvm_list which takes a names and retriels system table
entrties
by looking at the code that it uses, we can use that and kldsym to find the
symbols associated with every syscall to find all syscalls, and subsequently
detect and hide.
hooking kldsym so you can't find it.

* make it run as a kernel module
* doe the checkcalls using syscalls.h
* taake out the kvm_... functionality because it won't run in the kernel.
* compile the module.

## bonus
write and read for logging
presistance
networking
other syscalls to stop removal of above
